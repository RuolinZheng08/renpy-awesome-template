This project is a work in progress, featuring Ren'Py features that I frequently find myself using for different projects.

Here is a list of features showcased in this project:

- Expression composition screen
- Lightning mode (day, dusk, night, dim, sepia)
- Feather icon in the UI text
- Parallax BGs and CGs
- Eye-opening and closing transitions
- Additive blend mode
